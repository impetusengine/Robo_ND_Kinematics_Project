# Robo_ND_Kinematics_Project

This is the second project in the Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree. The goal of the project is to write a program that operates a 6 DOF robotic arm (Kuka KR210) to successfully pick up a cylinder from a shelf and place it into a bin. We first solve the inverse kinematics problem for the Kuka KR210 by kinematically decoupling equations into the parts of position and orientation. To solve for the first three joint variables, geometric projections of the wrist center's position is used to derive the equations. To solve for the last three joint variables, the forward kinematic equations from the orientation part of the third link to end effector transformation matrix are employed. Putting eveything together in a program, IK_server.py implements the joint variable equations to provide the service of joint angle calculation when called by RViz to process end effector trajectories into proper joint angle placements for Gazebo to simulate into robot arm action. The program successfully completed the pick and place task.
